# _Meal Tracker_

#### **By Sam Park**

## Project Description

* Create a meal tracking application. Users should be able to log foods they've eaten each day, including details about the meal and its number of calories. You may assume foods being logged are for a single day (you are not required to keep track of multiple days' meals).

## Objectives
* Does the application work as expected?
* Is the app structured in a logical way, including a model, multiple components and TypeScript? (Interfaces are not required).
* Can the application create and edit new instances of a model?
* Does the app allow you to view a list of foods?
* Can the application filter foods based on their calories?
* Are dependencies managed with npm and Bower?
* Does the app include a gulp-based asset pipeline with a development server?
* Does code meet standards from previous weeks?
* Is the project in a presentable, portfolio-quality state?
* Are you able to discuss the flow of your code and concepts behind it using correct terminology?


## User Stories

As a userâ€¦

* I want to log a food I have eaten by submitting a form with food name, calories and details.
* I want to view a list of foods I have logged.
* I want options to view all foods, only high-calorie foods (more than 500 calories), or only lower-calorie foods (less than 500 calories).
* I want to click a food to edit its name, details or calories (in case I decide to pretend my fries were 100 calories instead of 365).
